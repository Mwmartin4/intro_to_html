 <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
 <p>    Sport climbing is one of the most popular, as well as dangerous sports. It involves the Lead climber using
    two sided carabiners, or draws for short connected by fabric in the middle to clip the climbers rope into
    for safety. As a climber ascends a route, they clip the top carabiner into a bolt drilled into the rock,then clip
    the bottom carabiner into their rope. In case of a fall, or whipper as it is called, the rope tightens around
    the bottom carabiner aka draw, and stops their fall below their last clip point.</p>
<p>The beauty of sport climbing is found in the hyperfocus a climber gets knowing how costly a fall can be.
    Because of this a sport climber is more cautious than other forms of climbing and tends to need a higher endurance level.
    In short, rock climbing is a lot of fun as well as a huge rush!</p>
