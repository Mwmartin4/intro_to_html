    <h2>Welcome to my first site!</h2>

<p>Sport climbing: the act of climbing single- or multi-pitch routes, protected by permanently-fixed bolts and anchors drilled into the rock,
using a rope and the aid of a belayer.
The main difference between sport climbing and bouldering is the height of the routes being climbed,
and the form of protection (bouldering = no ropes, with crash pads). 
 
 Likewise, 
traditional climbing calls for the use of temporary gear and anchors (ex. nuts, camalots, etc.) to protect the climber,
as opposed to permanent ones used in sport climbing.The sport climbing process itself is relatively simple. A climber and a belayer tie into one end of a single rope,
with a few meters of rope between them. 
As the climbers ascends the route, s/he clips into carabiners spaced intermittently up the wall, each of which act as anchors to protect the climber from falls.
As the climber climbs, the belayer “feeds” him slack in the rope, and manually brakes any falls with the aid of a belay device.</p>
