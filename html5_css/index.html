        <p class="planet-info">Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and also the closest to the sun. Despite its small size, it has a very complex geological history, with evidence of past volcanic activity and tectonic deformation. Due to its proximity to the sun, it has a very thin atmosphere and extreme temperature variations.</p>
        <p class="planet-info">Despite being one of the easiest planets to observe from Earth, there is still much we don't know about Mercury. In 2011, NASA's Messenger spacecraft became the first spacecraft to orbit the planet, allowing scientists to gather new data about its composition, magnetic field, and surface features.</p>

        <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Mercury has a very eccentric orbit, which causes its distance from the sun to vary greatly.</li>
          <li>Mercury is named after the Roman messenger god.</li>
          <li>Due to its proximity to the sun, Mercury experiences the greatest gravitational force of any planet in our solar system.</li>

        <img src="venus.jpg" alt="Venus">
        <p class="planet-info">Venus is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition, but the two planets have very different atmospheres. Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with temperatures that can melt lead.</p>
        <p class="planet-info">Despite its harsh environment, Venus has been a target of scientific exploration for decades. In the 1960s and 70s, the Soviet Union sent a series</p>
