        <h2>The Story so far</h2>
        
        <p>It is 2049; humans are now bioengineered, and they are also enslaved. 
            K is a replicant who is a member of the Los Angeles Police Department, 
            hunting and killing replicants who have fallen foul of the law. 
            His official job description is blade runner. 
            He retires a replicant named Sapper Morton whilst he is at a protein farm, 
            and he also finds the remains of a female replicant in a box under a tree. 
            She died during childbirth. K realizes that in finding her, he has also found knowledge that could start a war between humans and replicants; 
            the bioengineered humans were thought to not be able to reproduce biologically. 
            Finding the body of a pregnant woman shows that this is not the case.</p>

        <h3>The Chase</h3>
        <p>As the story progresses, and as K continues to search out the truth, the Head of Wallace corp
            tries to bury the truth of a replicant child, by sending in agents, like His "secretary" who first meets K while he is looking 
            in the electronic archives for the proof of a child. This secretary will continue chase throughout the Film
            as K gets closer and closer to the truth, as well as going rogue. Others along the way including the head of blade runner unit,
            also try to stop K, although a twist ending sees them fail.</p>
